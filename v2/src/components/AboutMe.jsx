      <p>
        I&apos;ve only recently started my tech journey in January 2024.
        I&apos;m currently diving into web development and loving every bit; I
        especially enjoy working on fun projects and learning new skills along
        the way! I&apos;m also a college student pursuing software engineering.
        Still, I hope to start studying computer science at the University of
        Guelph by next year.
      </p>
